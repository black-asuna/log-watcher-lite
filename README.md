# Log Watcher Lite 

**Log Watcher Lite** is a Python-based mini SOC tool that scans system authentication logs (`auth.log`) for signs of suspicious activity like failed logins, brute force attempts, and logins from blacklisted IP addresses.

This project simulates the early steps of log analysis, often performed in real-world Security Operations Centers (SOCs), and is built to reinforce key cybersecurity analyst skills.

##  Features
- Detects:
  -  Multiple failed SSH login attempts
  -  Logins from blacklisted IPs
  -  Privilege escalation via `sudo`
- Outputs alerts in a structured `.csv` file
- Clean and customizable Python code

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/black-asuna/log-watcher-lite.git
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python parser.py
```

3. View alerts.csv for detection output.
